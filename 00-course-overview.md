This course introduces the version control system Git, an essential tool for tracking
and managing software development. Working with Git provides the flexibility to freely
make changes to your code and the security to know you can always get back to a working
state. You will learn to track the changes you made to your code and when you made them,
both using the command line and graphical tools.

Beyond working on your own code, understanding Git allows usage of online code
repositories such as GitHub. Using an online repository to publish your code is a great
way to disseminate your research and a necessary step to collaborate with others. This
course will demonstrate how to publish code to GitHub and introduce some of its basic
features and functionality, while the [Intermediate course][intermediate-course]
introduces more features that make it a productive collaborative environment.

This course (particularly the first half) is closely based on this [Code Refinery lesson][code-refinery].

## Syllabus

- An introduction to Git concepts and terminology.
- Using Git to track and visualise changes in your code.
- How to prepare your code for publication.
- Publishing your code using GitHub.
- Using GitHub Issues to manage your ToDo list in relation to the software.
- Using graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to Git

## Learning outcomes

After completing this workshop, you will be better able to

- Use the version control software Git to record and track changes to a code base
- Publish your code to a public repository
- Maintain your code repository up to date and in sync with your local copy
- Manage project action items with GitHub Issues
- Use a graphical user interface to Git
- Understand how and where to access support from the Research Computing Service at Imperial College

## Delivery of the course

Material will be delivered as a lecture with tasks for you to complete, following the Carpentries
teaching style.

- The instructor will walk you through the theoretical material of the course,
  demonstrating the execution of the relevant code and instructions. **You are highly encouraged to
  code along** and execute the instructions at the same time.
- Throughout the lessons, there are **yellow boxes** highlighting particularly challenging
  or important concepts.
- There are also exercises in **orange boxes**. The instructor will give you time to try
  to do them yourself before going through the solution. This is often available in a
  folded part of the orange box, so you can check it at any time.
- When doing exercises, put a green sticker in your computer whenever you are done, or a
  pink/orange one if you need support. A helper will go to you.
- For online sessions, raise your hand if you are done with the exercise and write
 any questions or problems directly into the chat, so a helper can try to solve it.
